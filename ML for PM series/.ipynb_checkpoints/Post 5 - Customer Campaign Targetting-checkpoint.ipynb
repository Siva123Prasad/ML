    "Let's compare the options a PM should understand:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 1: Rule-based targeting\n",
    "- **How it works:** \"Send to everyone who opened the last campaign\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** Simple, no model needed, easy to explain\n",
    "- **Cons:** Misses complex patterns, can't handle multiple signals simultaneously\n",
    "- **When to use:** Never for production (too simplistic)\n",
    "- **PM perspective:** This is what marketing does today, and it's not working\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 2: Logistic regression\n",
    "- **How it works:** \"Calculate a weighted score based on features, predict probability\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** Fast, interpretable, works well with linear relationships\n",
    "- **Cons:** Assumes linear relationships, doesn't capture feature interactions\n",
    "- **When to use:** When you need extreme speed and simplicity\n",
    "- **PM perspective:** Good baseline, but leaves ROI on the table\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 3: Gradient boosting (XGBoost, LightGBM)\n",
    "- **How it works:** \"Build sequential trees, each correcting previous errors\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** Highest accuracy, handles complex patterns\n",
    "- **Cons:** Slower to train, harder to explain, can overfit\n",
    "- **When to use:** When you need maximum accuracy and have ML expertise\n",
    "- **PM perspective:** Overkill for most use cases, hard to explain to stakeholders\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Option 4: Random forest (our choice)\n",
    "- **How it works:** \"Build many decision trees, average their predictions\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** \n",
    "  - Handles non-linear relationships\n",
    "  - Captures feature interactions naturally\n",
    "  - Works well with imbalanced data\n",
    "  - Provides feature importance\n",
    "  - Less prone to overfitting than single trees\n",
    "  - Interpretable enough for stakeholders\n",
    "- **Cons:** Slower than logistic regression (but still fast enough)\n",
    "- **When to use:** When you need accuracy + interpretability + robustness\n",
    "- **PM perspective:** Best balance of performance and explainability\n"

    "- Segment + engagement + timing create interactions that logistic regression can't capture\n",

    "**2. Data is highly imbalanced**\n",
    "- Only 3-4% of campaigns result in clicks\n",
    "- Random forest with class balancing handles this well\n",

    "- Tier 1 (hot): Clicked in last 30 days\n",
    "- Tier 2 (warm): Opened in last 60 days\n",
    "- Tier 3 (cold): No engagement in 90+ days\n",

    "\n",
    "**Finding:** Campaign Champions and Engaged Browsers have 2-3x higher response rates than At-Risk Dormant customers.\n",

    "**What this means for PMs:**\n",
    "- One-size-fits-all campaigns waste budget on wrong segments\n",
    "- Segment-specific campaigns perform better\n",
    "- Combining segment + engagement score = smarter targeting\n",

    "- High-Value: Monthly product launches\n",

    "- A low-value customer with 10% response rate might not be\n",
    "- ROI = (CLV × response rate) - campaign cost\n",

    "- **Churn risk (post 1):** Prioritize retention campaigns\n",
    "- **Segments (post 2):** Tailor messaging by customer type\n",
    "- **Recommendations (post 3):** Personalize campaign content\n",
    "- **CLV (post 4):** Allocate budget intelligently\n",

    "Clear probability scores mean clear decisions:\n",
