    "### ML approach: collaborative filtering + product affinity\n",
    "\n",
    "#### The core idea \n",
    "\n",
    "**\"People who bought similar things to you also bought THIS.\"**\n",
    "\n",
    "That's collaborative filtering. It's how Netflix recommends shows, Amazon recommends products, and Spotify recommends songs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why this approach?\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's compare the options a PM should know:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Option 1: Rule-based recommendations (current system)\n",
    "- **Logic:** \"Show the 10 most popular products to everyone\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** Simple, easy to implement\n",
    "- **Cons:** Not personalized, ignores customer preferences, low conversion\n",
    "- **When to use:** Never, unless you have zero data\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Option 2: Content-based filtering\n",
    "- **Logic:** \"If you bought running shoes, recommend more running shoes\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** Works for new products, doesn't need other customers' data\n",
    "- **Cons:** Creates filter bubbles, no discovery, repetitive recommendations\n",
    "- **When to use:** When you have rich product metadata but limited transaction history\n",
    "\n",
    "##### Option 3: Collaborative filtering (our choice)\n",
    "- **Logic:** \"Find customers similar to you, see what they bought, recommend those products\"\n",
    "- **Pros:** Personalized, enables discovery, learns from collective behavior, scalable\n",
    "- **Cons:** Cold start problem (new users/products have no history)\n",
    "- **When to use:** When you have transaction history for many customers (which we do)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Why we chose collaborative filtering:**\n",
    "1. We have years of transaction data\n",
    "2. We want to enable product discovery (not just \"more of the same\")\n",
    "3. We want personalization without complex product metadata\n",
    "4. It's proven to work at scale (Amazon, Netflix use variations of this)\n"

    "|-------------|-----------|-----------|-----------|-----------|\n",

    "### Why this solution works \n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. It's based on actual behavior, not assumptions\n",
    "\n",
    "Rule-based systems assume you know what customers want. Collaborative filtering learns from what customers actually do.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. It enables discovery\n",
    "\n",
    "Unlike \"show similar products,\" collaborative filtering can recommend products in different categories if similar customers bought them together.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. It's scalable\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the similarity matrix is calculated (can be done offline), generating recommendations is fast. Works for millions of customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. It's interpretable\n",
    "\n",
    "You can explain to stakeholders: \"We recommend this because customers with similar purchase history bought it.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 5. It improves over time\n",
    "\n",
    "As you get more transaction data, recommendations get better. The model \"learns\" from collective behavior.\n"
