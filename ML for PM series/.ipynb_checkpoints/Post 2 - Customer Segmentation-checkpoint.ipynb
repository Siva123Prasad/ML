    "### Why this post follows Post #1\n",
    "\n",
    "In Post #1, we predicted **which** customers are at risk of churning.  \n",
    "Now, we need to understand **who** they are.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While the churn model flags high-risk customers, marketing asks:  \n",
    "**\"Are these customers similar? Or do they need different strategies?\"**  \n",
    "\n",
    "Without segmentation, we might treat everyone the same, wasting resources or missing opportunities.  \n",
    "With data-driven customer profiles, marketing can personalize interventions—saving budget and increasing retention.\n",
    "\n",
    "This post shows how to find these customer groups using behavior and value metrics, so we can act smarter—based on who they are, not just their risk score.\n"

    "### Problem statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The marketing VP walked into the room after seeing our churn model results and said:\n",
    "\n",
    "\"Great, we know who's leaving. But who ARE these people? Are they all the same? Or do we need different strategies for different groups?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "The team had been using a simple manual segmentation:\n",
    "- \"Premium\" vs \"Standard\" vs \"Basic\" (based on subscription tier)\n",
    "- \"New\" vs \"Active\" vs \"Dormant\" (based on rough activity guesses)\n",
    "\n",
    "But nobody trusted these labels. They felt arbitrary.\n",
    "\n",
    "The real questions we needed to answer:\n",
    "- Do we have behavioral data beyond just demographics?\n",
    "- Can we find natural groupings in customer behavior?\n",
    "- What patterns emerge when we look at purchase history, engagement, and value together?\n",
    "\n",
    "Marketing was spending the same on all \"Standard\" customers, but some were worth more and other were worth less.\n",
    "\n",
    "We needed data-driven segmentation that reflected actual customer behavior.\n"

    "### Dataset overview\n",
    "\n",
    "We used the same Customer Data Platform (CDP) with 5,000 customers from Post #1.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Tables used:\n",
    "- **cdp_customers** - Customer demographics\n",
    "- **cdp_customer_features** - Pre-calculated behavioral metrics (RFM, engagement)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Features for segmentation:\n",
    "\n",
    "We selected 9 key behavioral and value metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. `recency_days` - Days since last purchase\n",
    "2. `frequency` - Total number of purchases\n",
    "3. `monetary_value` - Total customer spend\n",
    "4. `avg_order_value` - Average transaction size\n",
    "5. `engagement_score` - Overall platform engagement\n",
    "6. `email_open_rate` - Email engagement level\n",
    "7. `email_click_rate` - Click-through behavior\n",
    "8. `campaign_conversions` - Campaign response history\n",
    "9. `customer_lifetime_value` - Predicted total value\n",
    "\n",
    "**Key insight:** We combined RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) with engagement metrics to capture both spending behavior and brand connection.\n"

    "### ML approach\n",
    "\n",
    "**Problem type:** Unsupervised learning - clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "**Algorithm:** K-means clustering\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Why K-means?\n",
    "- Simple and interpretable\n",
    "- Fast to train on thousands of customers\n",
    "- Produces clear, distinct segments\n",
    "- Easy to explain to marketing stakeholders\n",
    "- Scales to millions of customers in production\n",
    "\n",
    "#### How it works:\n",
    "1. Group customers by similarity across all 9 features\n",
    "2. Each customer is assigned to their nearest cluster center\n",
    "3. Segments are defined by shared behavioral patterns, not arbitrary rules\n",

    "\n",
    "This segment spent an average of $2,369 per customer vs. $382 for at-risk dormant customers.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Implication:** Marketing should allocate budget proportionally. Losing one high-value customer equals losing 6 at-risk customers in revenue terms.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Engagement does not equal spending (but it should)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Engaged browsers have 38.5% email open rates but only $643 CLV**\n",
    "\n",
    "Meanwhile, high-value customers have just 3.6% email open rates but spend 3x more.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Insight:** High engagement is wasted if it doesn't convert to purchases. Engaged browsers are prime candidates for conversion campaigns.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 3. The dormant majority is a resource drain\n",
    "\n",
    "**57.6% of customers are at-risk dormant with minimal engagement**\n",
    "\n",
    "They consume marketing resources (emails, campaigns, support) but contribute only 22.8% of revenue.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Action:** Test aggressive win-back. If they don't respond after 2 campaigns, deprioritize or remove from active lists.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 4. Campaign champions are influencers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Just 19 customers (0.4%) have 42.8% email open rates and 65% click rates**\n",
    "\n",
    "These customers are brand advocates in waiting.\n",

    "Building the segmentation model was straightforward.  \n",
    "Making it **operational** is where the real work begins.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### What's needed for production:\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 1. Automated re-segmentation\n",
    "- Customers move between segments over time\n",
    "- Re-cluster monthly or quarterly\n",
    "- Track segment migration patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 2. CRM integration\n",
    "- Push segment labels to Salesforce, HubSpot, or marketing automation\n",
    "- Enable campaign targeting by segment\n",
    "- Create dashboards showing segment health\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 3. Campaign measurement\n",
    "- Track campaign performance by segment\n",
    "- Measure: Does personalized messaging outperform generic?\n",
    "- A/B test: Segment-specific offers vs. one-size-fits-all\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 4. Cross-functional alignment\n",
    "- Marketing needs to understand what each segment represents\n",
    "- Sales needs different scripts for high-value vs. dormant customers\n",
    "- Product team prioritizes features based on high-value needs\n",
    "\n",
    "##### 5. Governance\n",
    "- Document how segments are defined\n",
    "- Ensure segment logic is explainable to leadership\n",
    "- Avoid \"black box\" models that stakeholders don't trust\n",
